1* {

    ${selectedCourse?.index === idx ? 'selected-course' : ''}
    its will check if the selectedCourse index is equal to the current index if yes then it will add the selected-course class    
    the First ? is to check weather the selectedCourse is not null(object) if is a object then it will become True

}

        Let's say this is the course:

    course = {
    title: "EEE2001-Power Systems",
    badge: "18"
    }
    index = 1
    Then this:

    setSelectedCourse({ ...course, index });
    Becomes:


    setSelectedCourse({
    title: "EEE2001-Power Systems",
    badge: "18",
    index: 1
    });
}
